# Fees Tracking System (POC)

This is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for a Student Fees Tracking System.  
It allows you to manage enrollments, track student fees, and handle payments efficiently.

The project is built using **Angular 19**, **NGXS**, **PrimeNG**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented So Far

### 1. View Enrollments

- Display a list of all students with details such as:
  - Name, contact, batch, fees, EMIs, total received, and payment status.
- **Filter enrollments** by batch, student name, and payment status.
- The table is implemented using **PrimeNG Table** with responsive layout.
- Payment status is color-coded for clarity:
  - **Full Paid** ‚Äì green
  - **Partial Paid** ‚Äì yellow
  - **Pending** ‚Äì red

---

### 2. Add Enrollment

- Add new students with batch and payment information.
- Implemented using **PrimeNG Dynamic Dialog** for a smooth user experience.
- Form built with **Reactive Forms** with validations:
  - Required fields
  - Minimum values and length checks
- On submission:
  - Enrollment is **added to the NGXS store** immediately.
  - Success or error messages are displayed using **PrimeNG Toast**.

---

### 3. Filters for Enrollments (New Feature)

- Users can filter enrollments dynamically based on:
  - **Batch ID**
  - **Student Name**
  - **Payment Status**
- Filtering is **flexible and reactive**:
  - Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously.
  - Only the filters provided are applied.
  - If no match exists, the table correctly shows **‚ÄúNo results found.‚Äù**
- Filtering logic is fully handled in **NGXS state**, ensuring the UI updates automatically.

---

### 4. State Management with NGXS

- **NGXS** manages all application state reactively.
- Key states:
  - `EnrollmentState` ‚Äì stores all student enrollment data.
  - `BatchesState` ‚Äì stores batch information.
- Supported actions:
  - `GetEnrollments` ‚Äì fetch all enrollments.
  - `PostEnrollment` ‚Äì add a new enrollment.
  - `GetEnrollmentsByFilter` ‚Äì filter enrollments dynamically.
  - `GetBatches` ‚Äì fetch available batches.
  - `ClearEnrollmentsFilter` ‚Äì reset filters to show all enrollments.
- **Filtered enrollments** are stored separately in the state to allow easy **reset/clear filters**.
- Components automatically update when state changes.

---

### 5. Responsive Layout

- Layout built using **Tailwind CSS grid system**.
- PrimeNG tables and dialogs adapt to different screen sizes.
- Ensures a seamless experience on desktop and mobile.
